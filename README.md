# Raspberry Pi Kiosk
## The objective
The objective of the Raspberry Pi Kiosk is to be used as as Digital Signage system, showing a HTML file, showing: the time, iFrame of Glances (my main Linux server) providing important stats, the date and time, as well as my Google Calendar Agenda.

## How this will be achieved
I hope to achieve this Digital Signage Kiosk using either a Raspberry Pi 3, or Raspberry Pi Zero. On the Pi's will be running Raspbian Jessie, with Google Chromium and x11server installed.

## Web Design
A web design screenshot will be going here soon!

## Practical considerations
There are a few pratical considerations which need to be taken into account when planning for this project. The first of those is that the Raspberry Pi needs to be able to mount to the back of the TV which the Digital Signage will be shown on.

A picture of the mounting solution as well as the Pi on the TV will be going here soon!
